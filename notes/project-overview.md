## Project Description

A Sudoku application that will offer the user the opportunity to solve a puzzle. Puzzles can be started via the following
two ways:
1. Random puzzle that the program knows about.
2. A puzzle that the user inputs from another source. (Ex. Newspaper Puzzle)

The application will allow the user to take notes in each grid, much as you would when playing with a pencil and
eraser. When all boxes have a number input, the user will have to opportunity to have the puzzle checked for
correctness.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

#### MVP 

* a - Have an empty board by default where users can input their own sudoku board.
* b - Have a clean UI / Color Theme up and running.
* c - When the board is full, check if it is filled in correctly and alert the user of success or failure.


#### PostMVP 

* d - Add default game boards.
* e - Generate game boards.
* f - Allow user to take notes.
* g - Give user ability to identify which numbers are inserted incorrectly.
* h - Create an animation of the computer solving the board.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Default game board. | H | 2hrs|  | 2 hrs |
| Check if valid board. / Alert User | H | 2.5 hrs|  | 1 hr |
| Clean UI / Color Theme | H | 3hrs|  | 5 hrs |
| Refactoring / Design | H | 4 hrs |  | 3 hrs |
| Allow user to take notes. | H | 3hrs | | |
| Add default game boards. | L | 1.5hrs|  |  |
| Give user ability to identify which numbers are inserted incorrectly. | L | 3hrs | | |
| Generate boards randomly. | L | 5hrs | | |
| Create an animation of computer solving board. | L | 5hrs+ | | |
